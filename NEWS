1.3.5
-----

1.3.5 fixes several minor issues, including the gathering of tests when using
package notation, using the coverage plugin with multiprocessing, and several
others.  See the CHANGELOG for more details.

Also note that psychoacoustics 1.x is in maintenance mode.  We will not be
looking to add any features, and you should seriously consider
looking at psychoacoustics2 as the way forward.

If you're interested in the future of psychoacoustics, please take a look at the
psychoacoustics2 project on github (https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/psychoacoustics2) or pypi
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/psychoacoustics2/0.5.0).
