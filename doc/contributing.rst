Contributing to psychoacoustics
====================

You'd like to contribute to psychoacoustics? Great! Now that psychoacoustics is hosted under
`GitHub <http://github.com/>`__, contributing is even easier.

Get the code!
-------------

Start by getting a local working copy of psychoacoustics from github::

  git clone https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/psychoacoustics

If you plan to submit changes back to the core repository, you should set up a
public fork of your own somewhere (`GitHub <http://github.com/>`__ is a good
place to do that). See GitHub's `help <http://help.github.com/>`__ for details
on how to contribute to a Git hosted project like psychoacoustics.

Running psychoacoustics's tests
--------------------

psychoacoustics runs its own test suite with `tox
<http://codespeak.net/tox/>`. You don't have to install tox to run
psychoacoustics's test suite, but you should, because tox makes it easy to run
all tests on all supported python versions. You'll also need python
2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.1 and jython installed somewhere in your $PATH.

Discuss
-------

Join the `psychoacoustics developer list
<http://groups.google.com/group/psychoacoustics-dev>`__ at google groups. It's
low-traffic and mostly signal.

What to work on?
----------------

You can find a list of open issues at psychoacoustics's `issue tracker
<http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/psychoacoustics/issues>`__. If you'd like to
work on an issue, leave a comment on the issue detailing how you plan
to fix it, or simply submit a pull request.

I have a great idea for a plugin...
-----------------------------------

Great! :doc:`Write it <plugins/writing>`. Release it on `pypi
<http://pypi.python.org>`__. If it gains a large following, and
becomes stable enough to work with psychoacoustics's 6+ month release cycles, it
may be a good candidate for inclusion in psychoacoustics's builtin plugins.
