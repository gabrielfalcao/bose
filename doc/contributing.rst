Contributing to bose
====================

You'd like to contribute to bose? Great! Now that bose is hosted under
`GitHub <http://github.com/>`__, contributing is even easier.

Get the code!
-------------

Start by getting a local working copy of bose from github::

  git clone https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/bose

If you plan to submit changes back to the core repository, you should set up a
public fork of your own somewhere (`GitHub <http://github.com/>`__ is a good
place to do that). See GitHub's `help <http://help.github.com/>`__ for details
on how to contribute to a Git hosted project like bose.

Running bose's tests
--------------------

bose runs its own test suite with `tox
<http://codespeak.net/tox/>`. You don't have to install tox to run
bose's test suite, but you should, because tox makes it easy to run
all tests on all supported python versions. You'll also need python
2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.1 and jython installed somewhere in your $PATH.

Discuss
-------

Join the `bose developer list
<http://groups.google.com/group/bose-dev>`__ at google groups. It's
low-traffic and mostly signal.

What to work on?
----------------

You can find a list of open issues at bose's `issue tracker
<http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/bose/issues>`__. If you'd like to
work on an issue, leave a comment on the issue detailing how you plan
to fix it, or simply submit a pull request.

I have a great idea for a plugin...
-----------------------------------

Great! :doc:`Write it <plugins/writing>`. Release it on `pypi
<http://pypi.python.org>`__. If it gains a large following, and
becomes stable enough to work with bose's 6+ month release cycles, it
may be a good candidate for inclusion in bose's builtin plugins.
